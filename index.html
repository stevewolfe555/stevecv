            <p>I am a highly self-motivated individual full of innovative  ideas and concepts. I enjoy being thrown head first into exciting opportunities  and being faced with new challenges. I can work collaboratively in diverse  teams and believe myself to be a fantastic team player. I can also competently  and confidently manage a team using my excellent communication and leadership  skills which I have learnt throughout my career.</p>
            <p>I currently work for myself offering my clients a range of  online solutions focusing around Website Development, Internet Marketing and  Support.</p>
            <p>Continually developing my skills I research and practice  some of the latest technologies and methodologies for implementing my work.  When working on larger projects I take the opportunity to hire in freelancers  where by I can expand on my management skills.</p>

       	    <h2 class="section-title">Transferable Skills</h2>
            <p><strong>Time management</strong> - This skill has been developed from running projects of my own and assessing the scope clearly in order to plan my time effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Team working</strong> - I am a great team player I work to towards making sure that I work well with everyone in my team in order to achieve the best result.</p>
            <p><strong>Self motivation and initiative</strong> - From being the only IT personnel in a small business to working for myself I have had to use initiative to set myself projects and manage them.</p>
            <p><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> - To me this means working towards the goals of the business and not just doing your job. I believe in going outside of the role and identifying new approaches and concepts to help develop the business.</p> 
            <p><strong>Communication</strong> - Many believe me to be out going I find it very easy to approach people and build rapport. In my working career I have been able to adapt this skill into sales roles, reporting to management on a non technical level and talking through ideas with clients.</p>

				<h3>Osteotec</h3>
				<p>Hi Steve, many thanks for all your help over the last year or so, you did a great job.</p>

				<h3>Life Change Fitness</h3>
				<p>Stephen Wolfe designed and made my website and I cannot recommend them enough. The website was made very easy on the eye and I have had a lot of great comments from it since then. My knowledge on computers/websites is awful so it was great how they got exactly what I needed, quickly, and went away and produced the website. Interweb60 is very professional and works to an extremely high standard. As I said, I cannot recommend him enough.</p>

				<p>Stephen has built several web sites for me and provides an ongoing support service. I highly recommend his professional services and would be happy to provide an excellent reference.</p>
